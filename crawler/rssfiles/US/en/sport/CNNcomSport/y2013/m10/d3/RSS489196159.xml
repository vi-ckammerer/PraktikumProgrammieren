<ExtractedText>Bayern batters City in Champions League
October 2, 2013 -- Updated 2218 GMT (0618 HKT)
Franck Ribery opened the scoring for Bayern Munich in its victory at Manchester City.

(CNN) -- Arjen Robben said it all -- "We didn't expect an easy game like that."
Robben could have been forgiven for expecting more of a challenge from one of the most expensively assembled teams in European football.
But the Dutchman will not lose too much sleep over the way Manchester City capitulated against a Bayern Munich which simply oozed class.
Bayern, which won the European Champions League last year, claimed a 3-1 win -- a result which flattered City for the most part.

"The first 70 minutes we played some terrific football," Robben told Sky Sports.
"We were so dominant against a big team in Europe. We didn't expect an easy game like that.
"It is a compliment to our team but we expected more from City. We didn't give them any space, we pressed them right up to the goalkeeper and they just kicked it away. Sometimes they gave us too much space and we used space well."
City's disastrous flirtation with the Champions League was supposed to end with the arrival of new manager Manuel Pellegrini.
It has failed to make it past the group stage in its two previous attempts and it faces a challenge once more.
Make no mistake about it -- if this was a boxing contest then the referee would have brought this bout to a halt at halftime.
Bayern, which is highly fancied to successfully defend its title this year, produced a level of performance which City could only dream of.
From the moment Franck Ribery's drive somehow flew through the grasp of City's goalkeeper Joe Hart, Bayern was rampant.
City, which was beaten by Aston Villa in the Premier League at the weekend, looked off the pace and unable to keep up with their opponent.
That Bayern managed to score just once in the opening 45 minutes was the only surprise -- but it soon made sure of victory with the help of some inept City defending.
Behold the "Zlatan burger", a mountain of meat dedicated to Paris Saint-Germain's star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The $41 monster is the brainchild of French cafe manager Jean-Philippe Grandin.
The mercurial striker arrived at the Parc des Princes in 2012. His career has seen him play for some of Europe's biggest clubs, including Ajax, Inter Milan and Barcelona, winning eight league titles in four different countries.
PSG fanatic Grandin wanted a burger worthy of his team's towering forward. It weighs over one kilogram, including a 600 gram burger, three different types of cheese and a custom-made bun.
Ibrahimovic's first season in Paris ended in glory. The Swede scored 30 league goals as PSG stormed to the French First Division title.
As this picture shows "Le Zlatan" towers over other burgers on the menu at Doddy's Cafe. "We have a lot of homemade burgers on the menu, I wanted to invent an extraordinary burger," declared Grandin.
