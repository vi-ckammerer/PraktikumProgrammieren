<ExtractedText>Vettel's Singapore success
Niki Lauda on F1's most dangerous years
"Now it's clear that 99% of our energies will be concentrated on the 2014 project," Domenicali told Ferrari's official website.
"Ahead of the summer break we were striving hard for a performance gain in Singapore, on a track with characteristics that are particularly unsuitable for our car.
"Instead we lost even more ground, despite the fact that the F138 has improved in certain ways, otherwise Fernando would never have managed to do what he did in the second part of the race in terms of tire management.
Blog: Does F1 lack compelling characters?
"We still have some new parts for the car that we will bring to the coming races but, above all, we will now try to make the most out of what we already have."
Two-time world champion Alonso last week pledged his loyalty to Ferrari amid reported interest from former team McLaren, and on Saturday said he wants to extend his contract.

Lauda (left) and Hunt seen here during their heyday in the 1970s. Their battle during the 1976 season is one of motorsport's most compelling dramas and has now been dramatized in "Rush" -- which was released this September.
McLaren driver Hunt poses before the 1976 British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. The Briton, who died of a heart attack in 1993 aged 45, was one of F1's great characters. He earned the nickname "Hunt the Shunt" for his habit of crashing into fellow competitors.
By contrast, Austrian Lauda had a meticulous nature on and off the racetrack. The clash of personalities made for a compelling rivalry on and off the track during the 1976 season.
Lauda's crash at the Nurburgring at the beginning of August was the defining moment of the 1976 season. He suffered horrific burns and nearly lost his life but somehow found the courage to return to the track at Monza just 43 days later. The Ferrari driver conquered his fears and finished fourth to the amazement of everyone and the delight of the Tifosi.
Lauda attends the world premiere of "Rush" at London's Leicester Square. "I was happy to stay alive," he says of the crash at the Nurburgring. "Normally you get killed in this kind of accident. Then it was clear that the challenge now is to see can you ever comeback ... So I fought my way back five weeks later in Monza. I only had Hunt as a target and make sure he will not win the championship."
Lauda's return to the racetrack at Monza took "courage in its rawest form," says "Rush" director Ron Howard. "Both (Hunt and Lauda) were so truthful and so competitive. They just did things their way. And they would have scars of some of those decisions but they also got to own their own triumphs. You have to admire that. To me, that's the nobility of the story."
Current McLaren driver Jenson Button also attended the London premiere. Lauda's comeback was "amazing," the 2009 world champion said. "It's obvious how tough he found it ... You are going to be (scared) after a massive, scary incident. Things have changed in terms of safety over the last 40 years but there are still dangers involved. We understand that as drivers. As soon as you step into the cockpit you know that."
Hunt's son Tom attended the premiere. He said it was "surreal" watching the film for the first time. "There were so many different emotions. For me, it's easy in one way because I know it's not Dad up there and it's a Hollywood film. Ron and his team have done a fantastic job."
