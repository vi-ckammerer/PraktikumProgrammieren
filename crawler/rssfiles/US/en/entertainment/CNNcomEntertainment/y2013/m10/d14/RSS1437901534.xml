<ExtractedText>Gallery: Recasting Christian Grey in 'Fifty Shades of Grey'
By Lisa Respers France, CNN
October 15, 2013 -- Updated 1819 GMT (0219 HKT)
OK "Fifty Shades of Grey" fans, it looks like some of you have gotten your wish. Charlie Hunnam will not be playing Christian Grey in the big-screen adaptation of E.L. James' best-selling novel. You can once again start fantasizing about who might snag the role instead. Here are a few names that have come up.
Lots of people believed "White Collar's" Matt Bomer would have made a great Christian Grey. (The actor appears as a stripper in "Magic Mike," so we figured he'd be down for some on-screen BDSM.)
Garrett Hedlund steamed up the screen in "Tron: Legacy" and "Troy." He definitely has the looks for the role.
The devilish look of Ian Somerhalder has served him well on the TV series "The Vampire Diaries." He could bring that to the role.
Need we plead our case for Ryan Gosling?
With "The Hunger Games" under his belt, Wes Bentley could have taken on the role.
He's shown his range from "This Means War" to "People Like Us," so we know Chris Pine could have taken on Grey.
If new dad Chris Hemsworth isn't too busy wielding Thor's hammer to take part, he could have easily stepped into Grey's shoes.
