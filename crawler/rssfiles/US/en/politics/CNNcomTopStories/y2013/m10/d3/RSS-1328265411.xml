STORY HIGHLIGHTS
Three people were "captured," and authorities also seized weapons and vehicles
Interior minister characterizes the operation as a major blow against drug trafficking
Bolivia is one of the world's largest producers of coca, the raw ingredient in cocaine
(CNN) -- Money might not grow on trees, but what if it fell from the sky?
That's the awesome scenario described by Bolivian authorities who say they seized more than $1 million this week after a white bag was tossed from an airplane in Santa Cruz.
Anti-drug police first noticed a person signaling a plane, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. The money was thrown out as the aircraft flew low.
Interior Minister Carlos Romero characterized the operation, which took place Sunday, as a major blow against drug trafficking. It foiled attempts to set up a drug factory, he said in a statement.
Bolivia is one of the world's largest producers of coca, the raw ingredient in cocaine.
Three people were "captured," and authorities also seized weapons and vehicles, the Interior Ministry said.
An investigation is ongoing.
