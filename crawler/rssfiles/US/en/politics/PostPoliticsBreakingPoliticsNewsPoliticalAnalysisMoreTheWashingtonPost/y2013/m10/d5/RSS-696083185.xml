<description>&lt;p&gt;Why in the world would Ted Yoho ever back down? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This one is from a 72-year-old lady: ‘Way to go, tiger,’ ” said&lt;a data-xslt="_http" href="http://yoho.house.gov/"&gt; Yoho (R-Fla.)&lt;/a&gt;, a freshman congressman. In the middle of the government shutdown that he had helped bring on, Yoho is reading texts off his personal cellphone. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-ted-yoho-government-shutdown-is-the-tremor-before-the-tsunami/2013/10/04/98b5aa8c-2c3c-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html?wprss=rss_politics"&gt;Read full article &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='http://feeds.washingtonpost.com/c/34656/f/636655/s/32125e62/sc/7/mf.gif' border='0'/&gt;&lt;br clear='all'/&gt;&lt;div class='mf-viral'&gt;&lt;table border='0'&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign='middle'&gt;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ffor-ted-yoho-government-shutdown-is-the-tremor-before-the-tsunami%2F2013%2F10%2F04%2F98b5aa8c-2c3c-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=For+Rep.+Ted+Yoho%2C+government+shutdown+is+%E2%80%98the+tremor+before+the+tsunami%E2%80%99" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ffor-ted-yoho-government-shutdown-is-the-tremor-before-the-tsunami%2F2013%2F10%2F04%2F98b5aa8c-2c3c-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=For+Rep.+Ted+Yoho%2C+government+shutdown+is+%E2%80%98the+tremor+before+the+tsunami%E2%80%99" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ffor-ted-yoho-government-shutdown-is-the-tremor-before-the-tsunami%2F2013%2F10%2F04%2F98b5aa8c-2c3c-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=For+Rep.+Ted+Yoho%2C+government+shutdown+is+%E2%80%98the+tremor+before+the+tsunami%E2%80%99" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ffor-ted-yoho-government-shutdown-is-the-tremor-before-the-tsunami%2F2013%2F10%2F04%2F98b5aa8c-2c3c-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=For+Rep.+Ted+Yoho%2C+government+shutdown+is+%E2%80%98the+tremor+before+the+tsunami%E2%80%99" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2Ffor-ted-yoho-government-shutdown-is-the-tremor-before-the-tsunami%2F2013%2F10%2F04%2F98b5aa8c-2c3c-11e3-8ade-a1f23cda135e_story.html%3Fwprss%3Drss_politics&amp;t=For+Rep.+Ted+Yoho%2C+government+shutdown+is+%E2%80%98the+tremor+before+the+tsunami%E2%80%99" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/sc/7/rc/1/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/sc/7/rc/1/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/sc/7/rc/2/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/sc/7/rc/2/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/sc/7/rc/3/rc.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/sc/7/rc/3/rc.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/a2.htm"&gt;&lt;img src="http://da.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/a2.img" border="0"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img width="1" height="1" src="http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/176965257695/u/89/f/636655/c/34656/s/32125e62/a2t.img" border="0"/&gt;</description>

<ExtractedText>For Obama, domestic politics make foreign policy that much harder
Juliet Eilperin
Obama's canceled Asia trip shows how hard it is for him to pursue foreign policy when facing domestic problems.
Get the latest news on the budget fight and a possible government shutdown in this daily newsletter.
Here’s another. “It just says, ‘Shutdown,’ ” Yoho said. “With a smiley face.”
A year ago, Yoho was a large-animal veterinarian in north Florida who had never held elected office. Today, he is part of one of the most influential voting blocs in the House of Representatives, the hard-line conservatives who pushed their own leadership into a risky showdown over President Obama’s health-care law.
Right now — with national parks closed and workers furloughed and cancer studies shut down — Yoho is supposed to be learning a hard lesson, about being careful what you wish for.
He is not.
Instead, Yoho has felt little pressure to change his mind, either from inside the Capitol or outside it. His leaders are still weak and uneasy. His constituents — or at least the small slice that bothers to write or call him — are mostly supportive. And his defiance has made him far more powerful than a freshman congressman has any right to expect.
So he’s already planning for a bigger act of defiance.
“You’re seeing the tremor before the tsunami here,” Yoho said. “I’m not going to raise the debt ceiling.”
Yoho, 58, is a genial man who has decorated his office with photos of his old patients: cattle. He won his office last year by defeating 23-year veteran Rep. Cliff Stearns (Fla.) in a GOP primary, and then cruising to victory in a deep-red district. His slogan was “. . . had enough? ”
Today, Yoho compares his role in the American political system to the role that Fred Flintstone’s feet played, in Fred Flintstone’s car.
He is the squealing brake.
“I see one side of our government, or two-thirds of it, running 100 miles an hour toward socialism,” Yoho said, meaning Obama and the Democratic-led Senate. He knows people agree with him on that, he said, because he asks people about it at town-hall meetings: “ ‘How many people feel we’re heading into socialism?’ Hands go up.”
So, Yoho said, conservatives “are like Fred and Barney in the Flintstone-mobile, trying to stop that.” This year, that meant trying to defund Obama’s health-care law, even at the risk of shutting down the government.
Then the government shut down.
Yoho’s own son Tyler was furloughed from his job in the office of Rep. Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.) . And, in Yoho’s small office suite, some of the messages from constituents began to take a dark turn.
“As it’s gone on, the cursing has gotten a little bit worse,” said Omar Raschid, Yoho’s deputy chief of staff, conceded Wednesday.
“I [expletive] hate you,” a constituent from Gainesville, Fla., wrote Wednesday, under the subject line “You sucking at life.” “You have ruined everything this party used to stand for and I [expletive] hate you for that.”
The calls were sometimes just as bad.
“He hates poor people and old people. How could you work for such a man?” somebody told staffer Brittany Posobiec. The caller said the Affordable Care Act would help those groups and that the shutdown would make their lives worse. The caller said Posobiec needed to reexamine her “life’s path” since it had led her to Yoho’s office.
