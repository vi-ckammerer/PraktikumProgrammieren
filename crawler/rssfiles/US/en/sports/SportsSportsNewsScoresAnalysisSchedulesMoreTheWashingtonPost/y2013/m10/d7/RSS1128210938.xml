<ExtractedText>Which Week 5 game excites you most?
Desmond Bieler
With the Redskins on a bye, we rank the remarkable number of games still very much worth watching.
Kent Babb and Mark Maske
Amid mounting safety concerns, NFL commissioner says ‘game is safer and more exciting today than ever.’
Photos of the day
Egypt violence, Iraq bombing, opening of East Asian Games, China typhoon and more.
That would mean a stop by his defense, which was a rare sight Sunday, or maybe a second interception by Peyton Manning , which this season has been much rarer. Instead, Romo sat there as Manning engineered his ninth scoring drive of the afternoon. When Denver place kicker Matt Prater’s field goal went through the uprights for the 51-48 win , it was Romo who made the slow walk to the center of the field to congratulate the other team’s quarterback.
“It’s funny,” Romo said without a smile afterward. “You can get over the win pretty quick and get ready for the next opponent. When you lose, it just eats at you. It grinds away at you: What could we have done? What should I have done? . . . So, yeah, this will take us some time.”
This was a particularly brutal loss for Dallas, which if nothing else Sunday made its case as the best team in the NFL’s worst division. In a contest between big offenses and  struggling defenses — 99 total points, 1,039 combined yards and five possessions that ended without a score — Romo was the brightest star.
But has a game ever told the Romo story so perfectly? He is dazzling and dependable until the end, bad luck or pressure caving him in. He broke Don Meredith’s 50-year-old team record Sunday with 506 passing yards, but it will be that interception that’s remembered.
“He played as good a football game as I’ve ever seen him play,” Dallas Coach Jason Garrett said afterward.
And for 58 minutes, he was as good as any quarterback in the league — even the one on the other sideline. Romo completed passes of 79 and 82 yards, scrambling out of danger and finding open receivers when it seemed impossible. He led the Cowboys to a 14-0 lead against the unbeaten Broncos, and after Manning led his team to touchdowns on five straight possessions, Romo brought Dallas back.
“Tony throughout the ballgame just found the answers,” said Garrett, whose team is tied with Philadelphia at 2-3 and somehow the division lead .
For a long time Sunday, it seemed as if Romo would be the charmed one and not the 37-year-old Manning. The old man was terrific, his four touchdown passes perhaps overshadowed only by his first rushing touchdown in five years. But for the first time this season, he wasn’t perfect. Manning had thrown 20 touchdown passes and zero interceptions before Morris Claiborne picked him off late in the third quarter.
Romo followed with a five-play, 51-yard drive that finished with a touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten and a 41-38 Dallas lead.
“I did not know Romo was that slippery,” Broncos linebacker Danny Trevathan said. “But you can’t go in there underestimating quarterbacks, especially in this league.”
